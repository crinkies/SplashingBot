# SplashingBot
A splashing bot for OSRS with auto-login.


A magic splashing bot for the RuneLite client of Old School Runescape with an auto-login feature.

Change the value "password" to your ingame password and make sure the client has "remember username" checked.

Mark the npc you're attacking with the object marker plugin. Change the External.ahk pixel search color.

Add win.minimize() before win.activate() in the script to run with RuneLite minimized.
